## Intro
This was my first report in Power BI.

While I was working in the Human Resources Department, it was given me the opportunity to make an analysis of our employees, especially verify what was our TurnOver rate.

After some research about the subject, I found out the wonders of Power BI and that was how our story begin.

When doing the TurnOver analysis, I decided to go the extra mile and analyze our employees, in terms of new hires, departures, current employees and all those who have passed through the company.

Below I'll detail what's in this report.

Note: The values have been replaced with fictitious numbers.

### Introduction
**What is TurnOver?**

TurnOver is the name given to the flow of employees in and out of a company.

The turnover rate indicates the percentage of replacements of replaced by new employees in a given period of time.

It reveals the company's ability to retain employees and be attractive to them.

Normally, organizations aim to have a percentage of less than 10%.

**How is it calculated?**

[(((X Admissions + Y Exits)/2))/(Total Number of Employees)].100
